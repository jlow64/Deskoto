/*
This page needs to be able to have a cart item component, 
where a user can change the quantity of an item and remove items.
Info needs to be tied to a global state so the information can be reflected
application wide. Also need to have a shipping processing page and a 
third party payment page. Better to store sensitive data like payment info
with trusted third parties. Will need to link with recoil. Another option 
will be to also store the cart information state within cookies for unregistered
users.
